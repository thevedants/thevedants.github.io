								<p> Welcome! I'm a Computer Science student at Stanford University with a keen interest in artificial intelligence and technology innovation. I love tinkering with and exploring new technologies.
									
									My academic journey has introduced me to fascinating areas like machine learning, natural language processing, and brain-computer interfaces. I've had the opportunity to work on various projects that aim to solve real-world problems using technology.
									 I'm always eager to learn more and explore new ideas in tech.
									
									Feel free to look around and <a href = "#contact">reach out</a> if you'd like to discuss anything related to AI, technology, or potential collaborations. Thanks for stopping by!</p>

									My journey in computer science has been shaped by a diverse array of research experiences and innovative projects. Currently, I'm engaged in developing an Automatic Speech Recognition tool for the Bengali language. This project has allowed me to explore the intricacies of language processing and speech recognition technologies, particularly in the context of less-resourced languages.</p>
									
									<p>At Stanford University, I had the opportunity to work on two groundbreaking projects. The first involved developing an efficient Brain-Computer Interface for speech neuroprosthesis, utilizing a transformer-based encoder-decoder model. This experience deepened my understanding of the intersection between neuroscience and AI, showcasing the potential of technology to improve lives. In another project at the Stanford AI Lab, I engineered an autoformalization model for mathematical proofs using foundational models. This work involved fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance mathematical reasoning, resulting in improved performance on MMLU and Math datasets compared to baselines.</p>
									
									<p>My internship at the MIT Probabilistic Computing Project was another pivotal experience. There, I designed an English to InferenceQL machine translation model. This project not only improved upon pre-existing models but also deepened my expertise in natural language processing and machine translation.</p>
									
									<p>Beyond institutional research, I've led independent projects that have further honed my skills. Energen, a time series-based ML model for efficient electricity management, allowed me to apply machine learning techniques to real-world energy problems. I also authored a research paper on this project, further developing my academic writing skills. Another significant project was LingoGuru, a Sanskrit language learning app that I developed. This project involved implementing a modified edit-distance algorithm and introducing unique gamified features, showcasing my ability to blend technical expertise with user-centric design.</p>
									
									<p>My academic journey has been marked by several honors that have both validated my work and opened new opportunities. Being named a <a href="https://www.risefortheworld.org/global-winners/"> Rise Global Winner</a> was a significant milestone, recognizing my potential to make a global impact. As an RSI Scholar and Mehta Fellow at the <a href = "https://www.cee.org/about-us/alumni/2022-rickoids">Research Science Institute</a>, I received a full-ride scholarship that allowed me to engage with cutting-edge research at an early stage in my career. Additionally, winning a Bronze Medal at the <a href = "https://ioling.org/results/2021/">International Olympiad of Linguistics </a> underscored my analytical skills and passion for understanding complex systems, be they linguistic or computational.</p>
									
									These experiences and achievements have collectively shaped my path in AI and computer science. More importantly, they've fueled my passion for using technology to solve real-world problems. As I continue my journey, I'm excited to build upon these experiences and contribute to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the field of artificial intelligence and computer science.

									I have recently been intersted in web development and full stack engineering, this website being my first foray in the field.

								<h2 class="major">fun</h2>
								
								<p>

									When I'm not neck-deep in code or tinkering with AI models, you'll probably find me with my nose in a book, swinging a badminton racket, or geeking out over sports stats. I'm a total bookworm – my reading list is as eclectic as my Spotify playlists, jumping from sci-fi mind-benders to historical deep dives. On the court, I transform into a shuttlecock-smashing machine. There's nothing quite like the thrill of a well-executed drop shot to make you feel like a badminton ninja. And don't get me started on sports analytics – it's like my secret obsession. I love diving into player stats, crunching numbers, and trying to predict game outcomes. It's like solving a puzzle, but with added adrenaline. These hobbies aren't just fun breaks from my tech life; they keep my brain fizzing with new ideas and perspectives. So if you ever want to chat about the latest bestseller, challenge me to a match, or debate why your favorite team's stats prove they're the GOAT, I'm all ears!</p>
